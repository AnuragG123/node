Certainly! 

The code you've provided seems to deal with AWS S3 bucket operations using the boto3 library. When fetching objects or their versions from an S3 bucket, there might be a maximum limit (typically 1000 objects) to the number of results returned by a single request. To handle situations where there are more than this limit, you need to implement pagination.

Here's a way to implement pagination for deleting all objects in an S3 bucket:

1. For deleting objects:
```python
def delete_all_objects(bucket, prefix=''):
    s3_client = boto3.client('s3')
    paginator = s3_client.get_paginator('list_objects_v2')
    
    # Create an iterator for pages of object listings
    pages = paginator.paginate(Bucket=bucket, Prefix=prefix)
    
    for page in pages:
        if 'Contents' in page:
            objects_to_delete = [{'Key': obj['Key']} for obj in page['Contents']]
            s3_client.delete_objects(Bucket=bucket, Delete={'Objects': objects_to_delete})
```

2. For deleting object versions (including delete markers):
```python
def delete_all_object_versions(bucket, prefix=''):
    s3_client = boto3.client('s3')
    paginator = s3_client.get_paginator('list_object_versions')
    
    # Create an iterator for pages of object version listings
    pages = paginator.paginate(Bucket=bucket, Prefix=prefix)
    
    for page in pages:
        objects_to_delete = []
        
        if 'Versions' in page:
            for version in page['Versions']:
                objects_to_delete.append({'Key': version['Key'], 'VersionId': version['VersionId']})

        if 'DeleteMarkers' in page:
            for marker in page['DeleteMarkers']:
                objects_to_delete.append({'Key': marker['Key'], 'VersionId': marker['VersionId']})

        if objects_to_delete:
            s3_client.delete_objects(Bucket=bucket, Delete={'Objects': objects_to_delete})
```

Replace your original deletion methods with the ones provided above to ensure all objects and their versions (if any) are deleted from the S3 bucket, even if they number more than 1000.

Remember to handle exceptions appropriately and be extremely careful when performing delete operations, as this will permanently remove objects and their versions from the bucket.
