 Automated Redshift Secret Rotation with Terraform

In this comprehensive guide, we will walk you through the process of setting up an automated secret rotation mechanism for Amazon Redshift using Terraform. Automating the rotation of database credentials enhances security by regularly updating access keys and passwords, reducing the risk of unauthorized access. To achieve this, we will create an Amazon Redshift cluster, manage its credentials using AWS Secrets Manager, develop a Lambda function for secret rotation, and schedule the rotation process with CloudWatch Events, all orchestrated through Terraformâ€”a powerful infrastructure as code tool.

Introduction

As organizations strive to enhance the security of their cloud infrastructure, the management of database credentials becomes a pivotal concern. Amazon Redshift, a popular data warehousing solution, allows for powerful analytics but demands robust security practices. One such practice is the regular rotation of database credentials, reducing the window of exposure to potential threats.

This project demonstrates how to set up an end-to-end solution that automates the rotation of Amazon Redshift database credentials using Terraform. The process involves creating an Amazon Redshift cluster, establishing a secure storage solution with AWS Secrets Manager, designing a Lambda function for secret rotation, and scheduling the rotation process to occur at defined intervals using CloudWatch Events.

Context

Imagine you're tasked with architecting a secure and automated solution for managing Amazon Redshift credentials. This solution should regularly update the database credentials, minimizing the risk of unauthorized access due to compromised keys or passwords. Here's a high-level overview of the components and technologies involved:

Amazon Redshift: A fully managed, petabyte-scale data warehouse service that offers robust data analysis capabilities.

AWS Secrets Manager: A service that helps you protect access to your applications, services, and IT resources without the upfront investment and on-going maintenance costs of operating your infrastructure.

AWS Lambda: A serverless compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. We'll utilize it to create a function that updates Redshift credentials.

CloudWatch Events: A serverless event bus service that enables you to respond to events across your AWS infrastructure. We'll schedule the Lambda function execution using CloudWatch Events.

Terraform: An infrastructure as code tool that allows you to define and manage your cloud resources in a version-controlled manner.

Throughout this guide, we'll take a hands-on approach, providing you with detailed steps, explanations of Terraform attributes and values, and best practices for setting up this automated secret rotation solution. By the end of this project, you'll have a comprehensive understanding of how to create, manage, and schedule the rotation of Amazon Redshift credentials in a secure and automated manner using Terraform. Let's get started!

Steps to be followed:

Step 1: Create Redshift Cluster

Create a redshift.tf file to define the Redshift cluster:

resource "aws_redshift_cluster" "example" {

  cluster_identifier     = var.redshift_cluster_identifier

  node_type                = "dc2.large"

  master_username   = var.db_username

  master_password   = var.db_password

  cluster_type            = "single-node"

  database_name      = var.redshift_database_name

}



Create a variables.tf file to define your variables:

variable "db_username" {

  description = "Username for the Redshift cluster"

}

variable "db_password" {

  description = "Password for the Redshift cluster"

}

variable "redshift_cluster_identifier" {

  description = "Identifier for the Redshift cluster"

}

variable "redshift_database_name" {

  description = "Name of the Redshift database"

}

Step 2: Create Secrets Manager Secret

Create a secrets_manager.tf file to define your Secrets Manager secret:

resource "aws_secretsmanager_secret" "redshift_secret" {

  name = "redshift_secret"

}

resource "aws_secretsmanager_secret_version" "redshift_secret_version" {

  secret_id       = aws_secretsmanager_secret.redshift_secret.id

  secret_string = jsonencode({

    username   = var.db_username

    password   = var.db_password

  })

}



Step 3: Configure Secret Rotation

Create a secret_rotation.tf file to enable secret rotation for the Secrets Manager secret:

resource "aws_secretsmanager_rotation_schedule" "redshift_secret_rotation" {

  secret_id = aws_secretsmanager_secret.redshift_secret.id

  rotation_lambda_arn = "arn:aws:lambda:<region>:<account_id>:function/your-rotation-lambda"  # Replace with your Lambda ARN

rotation_rules {

    automatically_after_days = 30

  }

}

Step 4: Create Lambda Function

Create a directory named lambda_function and navigate into it:

Create a file named main.py with the following content (this Lambda function will rotate the Redshift secret):

import boto3

import logging



logger = logging.getLogger()

logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)



def lambda_handler(event, context):

    logger.info("Starting Redshift secret rotation")

    client = boto3.client("secretsmanager")

    secret_id = event["SecretId"]

    try:

        response = client.get_secret_value(SecretId=secret_id)

        current_secret = response["SecretString"]

        logger.info("Retrieved current secret")

        new_secret = {

            "username": "<new_username>",

            "password": "<new_password>"

        }



        response = client.put_secret_value(SecretId=secret_id, SecretString=json.dumps(new_secret))

        logger.info("Updated secret with new credentials")

    except Exception as e:

        logger.error("Error during secret rotation: {}".format(e))

        raise e

    logger.info("Secret rotation completed")



Zip the contents of the lambda_function directory:

zip -r lambda_function.zip .

Step 5: Upload and Deploy Lambda Function

Create a lambda.tf file to define your Lambda function:

resource "aws_lambda_function" "redshift_secret_rotation" {

  filename                    = "lambda_function.zip"

  function_name        = "redshift_secret_rotation"

  role                         = aws_iam_role.lambda_role.arn

  handler                   = "main.lambda_handler"

  runtime                  = "python3.8"

  source_code_hash = filebase64sha256("lambda_function.zip")

}

Step 5: Create IAM Role for Lambda

Create a iam.tf file to define your IAM role:

resource "aws_iam_role" "lambda_role" {

  name = "lambda_role"

  assume_role_policy = jsonencode({

    Version = "2012-10-17",

    Statement = [

      {

        Action = "sts:AssumeRole",

        Effect = "Allow",

        Principal = {

          Service = "lambda.amazonaws.com"

        }

      }

    ]

  })

}



resource "aws_iam_policy" "lambda_policy" {

  name = "lambda_policy"



  policy = jsonencode({

    Version = "2012-10-17",

    Statement = [

      {

        Action = [

          "secretsmanager:GetSecretValue",

          "secretsmanager:PutSecretValue"

        ],

        Effect   = "Allow",

        Resource = aws_secretsmanager_secret.redshift_secret.arn

      }

    ]

  })

}

resource "aws_iam_role_policy_attachment" "lambda_role_policy" {

  policy_arn = aws_iam_policy.lambda_policy.arn

  role           = aws_iam_role.lambda_role.name

}

Step 6: Schedule Lambda Function

Create a schedule.tf file to define a CloudWatch Event Rule that triggers the Lambda function on a schedule:

resource "aws_cloudwatch_event_rule" "lambda_schedule" {

  name                          = "lambda_schedule"

  description                = "Schedule for rotating Redshift secret"

  schedule_expression = "rate(30 days)"

}

resource "aws_cloudwatch_event_target" "lambda_target" {

  rule          = aws_cloudwatch_event_rule.lambda_schedule.name

  target_id = "lambda_target"

  arn          = aws_lambda_function.redshift_secret_rotation.arn

}
