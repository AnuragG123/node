          Connecting Quicksight with SecretsManager

Introduction:

AWS Secrets Manager is a service that helps you manage secrets securely. A secret is a piece of sensitive data, such as a password, access key, or SSH key. Secrets Manager can store secrets in a secure and encrypted format, and it can rotate secrets automatically.

QuickSight is a business intelligence service that allows you to analyse data and create visualizations. QuickSight can connect to a variety of data sources, including Amazon S3, Amazon Redshift, and Microsoft SQL Server.

This document describes how to connect QuickSight and Secrets Manager and sync the credentials whenever the credentials are rotated automatically.

Context:

In order to connect QuickSight and Secrets Manager, you need to first create a secret in Secrets Manager that contains the database credentials. You can then select this secret in QuickSight. QuickSight will create an IAM role called aws-quicksight-secretsmanager-role-v0 in your account. This role grants users in the account read-only access to the specified secrets.

When a QuickSight user creates an analysis from or views a dashboard that uses a data source with secrets, QuickSight assumes the aws-quicksight-secretsmanager-role-v0 IAM role. This role allows QuickSight to access the secret and retrieve the database credentials.

To ensure that QuickSight can automatically sync the credentials whenever they are rotated, you need to attach a rotation schedule to the secret.
